The time was <l:4>. I decided to eat my favourite <l:1>, which was in a beautiful <l:color> box. I pick up the box, and a loud noise comes from my window:

I went to the window to check what was going on and saw two old men playing a board game. One said: - Well, do you accept defeat? - <five> - The second one answered. I closed the window and went to eat my favourite <l:1>.
